The Great Big Book
==================

== Foreword

This book is the product of many years of effort, but very little of that effort
is mine. This Japanese woodcut by Kaigetsud≈ç Dohan is the culmination of years
of practice, and the expression of great contemplation of beauty. Modern
technology allows me to locate this with an easy Internet search and to include
it almost effortlessly in this foreword. Consider this author a mere conduit for
greatness.
