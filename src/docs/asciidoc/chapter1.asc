== Pathos and Bathos

> Pathos *noun* a quality that evokes pity or sadness

> Bathos *noun* an effect of anticlimax created by an unintentional lapse in
> mood from the sublime to the trivial or ridiculous

Pope coined the term *bathos* to refer to a sudden shift from lofty to trite. In
doing this he trivialised the ultimate theme of mortality.

The great tragedy of Romeo and Juliet inspires emotions and excites the reader
to pity for the heroine and her hero. Although their ultimate union is a
consummation devoutly to be wished, the plot denies the reader any such
satisfaction. Much of tragedy is inherently anticlimactic because it sets up a
hope before dashing it. This shift in mood from sublime hope to ridiculous
sorrow is the true bathos of tragedy.
